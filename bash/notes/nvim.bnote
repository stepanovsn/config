=H= Modes

Vim has seven basic modes:

- Normal
    Here all the normal editor commands can be used.
    Also known as 'command' mode.
- Visual
    Like Normal mode, but the movement commands extend a highlighted area.
    When a non-movement command is used, it is executed for the highlighted area.
- Select
    Behaves like common editors. Rarely used.
- Insert
    Text typing.
- Cmdline
    Entering one line of text at the bottom of the window.
- Ex
    Like cmdline for commands but after typing you remain in the Ex mode.
- Terminal
    All input (except CTRL-\) is sent to the process running in the current terminal buffer.

There're six additional modes which are not listed here.
One of them is Replace mode.

=h= Key bindings

                                Switch to mode:
=C= i I a A o O c C s S =N=     - Insert (details are given later in this document)
=C= : / ? ! =N=                 - Cmdline (details are given later in this document)
=C= v =N=                       - Visual
=C= V =N=                       - Visual line
=C= <C-v> =N=                   - Visual block
=C= R =N=                       - Replace
=C= gQ =N=                      - Ex

                                Go back to normal mode:
=C= <Esc> =N=                   - From any mode except Ex mode
=C= :visual =N=                 - From Ex mode

=H= Syntax

Vim has core syntax for editing actions.
Any action needs a target. It could be a motion or a text object.

- For regular motions (cursor-based): =c= [" + register][count][operator][count][motion] =n=
- For text objects (structure-based): =c= [" + register][count][operator][text-object] =n=

Here:
=c= " + register =n=        - What register to use
=c= operator =n=            - What to do (delete, change, yank, etc.)
=c= motion/text-object =n=  - Where to do it (move cursor or select text)
=c= count =n=               - How many times (optional multiplier)

Navigation actions are the same motions except they don't have any operator applied (a "null operator").

When you type an operator, Vim enters "operator-pending mode" and waits for:
- A motion/text object
- Another operator (for visual mode)
- Escape to cancel

Not all motions/text objects work with all operators, but mostly they do.
Below are listed not all but main motions/text objects/operators.

=h= Motions

The motion covers the content from cursor to specific location.

                                By character:
=C= h =N=                       - Left
=C= j =N=                       - Down

=C= "               =N=         Any text yanked or deleted without specifying another register automatically goes here
=C= 0               =N=         Yanked text
=C= 1-9             =N=         Deleted text (1 is the most recent, and so on)
=C= A-Z a-z         =N=         General-purpose
                                - Using a lowercase letter (e.g., "ay) replaces the content,
                                - while an uppercase letter (e.g., "Ay) appends to it.
